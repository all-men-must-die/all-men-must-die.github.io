<br>This paper presents an improved Othello game solver using the Hardware/Software Co-Design approach. Enhancements in Data Communication, Searching Algorithm, and Evaluation function have been made to beat the prevalent implementations. A novel 64-bit Communication model is proposed which transfers the current board position from the Processing System to the Programmable Logic through a 64-bit change board, instead of the complete 128-bit board. The proposal uses NegaScout searching algorithm along with Transposition Table and Node Ordering; and features like Opening Book, Killer Heuristics, and Bitboards. An Adaptive Evaluation function assigns variable weights to Mobility, Stability, Corner Occupancy, and Disc Differential depending upon the game stage. At a search depth of eight, the proposed communication model improves the communication overhead by 19.5%. Overall, the proposed design demonstrates 75.06% improved performance as compared to the prevalent implementation, and 6.53 times faster than its software implementation on the same platform.</br>

<br>This paper deals with realization of search algorithms used in the game solvers on the FPGA. Three algorithms namely Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and NegaScout are realized and compared amongst each other, and also with their software realization for the sake of completion. Results show that the FPGA based implementations are exceptionally faster than their software counterparts, with the NegaScout algorithm outperforming the conventionally used Alpha-Beta Pruning, and the Minimax algorithm, both in software and hardware. The NegaScout algorithm is 1.3 times faster than the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm and 2.6 times faster than the Minimax algorithm on hardware, while incurring a nominal cost in terms of FPGA resource utilization. </br><br>

      <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;font-size: 16px"> P. Dalmia, Vikas, A. Parashar, A. Tomar and N. Pandey, "Novel High Speed Vedic Multiplier Proposal Incorporating Adder Based on Quaternary Signed Digit Number System," 2018 31st International Conference on VLSI Design and 2018 17th International Conference on Embedded Systems (VLSID), Pune, 2018, pp. 289-294, doi: 10.1109/VLSID.2018.78.
<br> This paper presents a high-speed Vedic multiplier based on the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam sutra of Vedic mathematics that incorporates a novel adder based on Quaternary Signed digit number system. Three operations are inherent in multiplication: partial products generation, partial products reduction and addition. A fast adder architecture therefore greatly enhances the speed of the overall process. A Quaternary logic adder architecture is proposed that works on a hybrid of binary and quaternary number systems. A given binary string is first divided into quaternary digits of 2 bits each followed by parallel addition reducing the carry propagation delay. The design doesn't require a radix conversion module as the sum is directly generated in binary using the novel concept of an adjusting bit. The proposed multiplier design is compared with a Vedic multiplier based on multi voltage or multi value logic [MVL], Vedic Multiplier that incorporates a QSD adder with a conversion module for quaternary to binary conversion, Vedic multiplier that uses Carry Select Adder and a commonly used fast multiplication mechanism such as Booth multiplier. All these designs have been developed using Verilog HDL and synthesized by Synopsys Design Compiler. They have been realized using the open source NAN gate 15nm technology library. The proposal shows a maximum of 88.75% speed improvement with respect to Multi Value logic based 128Ã—128 Vedic multiplier while the minimum is 17.47%. </br> <br>

      <h3>An FPGA based floating point Gauss-Seidel iterative solver</h3>

      <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;font-size: 16px"> R. Joshi et al., "An FPGA based floating point Gauss-Seidel iterative solver," 2017 14th IEEE India Council International Conference (INDICON), Roorkee, 2017, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/INDICON.2017.8487543.
<br>In this paper, an FPGA-based single precision floating point hybrid iterative architecture for solving a linear system of equations is proposed. The novel architecture implements Gauss-Seidel method using a Jacobi method based building block. The design takes advantage of the fast convergence of Gauss-Seidel Method conflated with parallel, pipelined architecture of Jacobi Iterative solver resulting in a much efficient architecture with acceptable hardware augmentation. The whole design has been implemented in Verilog HDL, having Virtex 7 XCV2000T as targeted device. Other design optimizations include using modified high-speed radix 4 multiplier and optimized high-speed 2's complementer. The efficacy of the design is tested and implemented in solving nonsingular, exactly determined and strictly diagonally dominant coefficient matrix based dense and sparse linear system of equations with different number of variables. The design results in reduced number of iterations and equivalent speedups are presented, which are calculated factoring in, the increased delay effects.

      <h3>Fast Combinational Architecture for a Vedic Divider</h3>

      <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;font-size: 16px">A. Parashar, G. Aggarwal, R. Dang, P. Dalmia and N. Pandey, "Fast Combinational Architecture for a Vedic Divider," 2017 14th IEEE India Council International Conference (INDICON), Roorkee, 2017, pp. 1-5, doi: 10.1109/INDICON.2017.8487598.
<br>This paper proposes a fast, purely combinational implementation of a divider, based on the Dhwajanka Sutra of Vedic mathematics. Vedic mathematics offers algorithms that are computationally efficient over conventional arithmetic algorithms. Dhwajanka Sutra has been chosen as it is an algorithm efficient for all possible cases, unlike other sutras for division (Nikhilam and Paravartya) which are case specific. The simplicity of the Vedic algorithm implemented in combinational form has reduced computation time significantly The proposed design is compared with existing divider architectures implemented on an FPGA namely Non-restoring Algorithm based Divider, Vedic Divider (Paravartya Algorithm), Vedic Divider (Nikhilam Algorithm), Decimal Divider based on Newton Raphson algorithm, Decimal Divider based on SRT algorithm and Combination divider algorithms. The proposed vedic divider shows a maximum of 273.72% speed improvement while the minimum is 99.95%. The results have been validated using the Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7, on the Virtex5 (xc5vlx20T-2ff323) FPGA Target Technology and the design has been implemented in Verilog.</br>
